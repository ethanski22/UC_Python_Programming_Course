"""Higher Order Functions used for simulations of dice rolls.

Definition: An n-sided dice function takes no arguments and always returns an int from 1 to n, inclusive.

Types of n-sided dice functions:
 -  Randomized: a randomized dice function can be fair, meaning that ir produce each possible outcome 
    from 1 to n with equal probability. Examples: four_sided, six_sided
 -  Deterministic: a deterministic dice function will be used for testing.  Deterministic test dice functions always cycle
    through a fixed sequence of n values. 
 -  We write a make_fair_dice higher-order function to return a fair, randomized n-sided dice function.
 -  We write a make_test_dice higher-order function that will return a deterministic, testing n-sided dice function.
